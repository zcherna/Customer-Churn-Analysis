# Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model that will enable SyriaTel, a Telecommunications company, to better understand customer churn and make smarter decisions leveraging the insights of the data. Ultimately, their goal is to increase profits by reducing customer churn. At the end of my analysis, I present concrete recommendations to reduce customer churn based on my findings and discuss next steps for deployment of the predictive model going forward.
